EXPLANATION FOR PLAY STORE: Why app cannot use Storage Access Framework / Media Store API

Our app currently uses direct file access in specific scenarios due to technical requirements for Firebase Storage integration and file processing operations. We are committed to migrating to privacy-friendly practices.

CURRENT TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS:

1. Firebase Storage File Validation Requirements:
   - Before uploading files to Firebase Storage, our app must validate file existence and size to prevent failed uploads and ensure proper error handling
   - The Firebase Storage SDK requires file metadata validation (size, format) which currently relies on direct file access for accurate pre-upload validation
   - This validation is critical for our chat and task attachment features where users share files of various types and sizes

2. Image Processing and Compression:
   - Our app performs on-device image compression before upload to optimize bandwidth and storage costs
   - This compression process requires direct bitmap access and file I/O operations that are currently implemented using direct file paths
   - The compression algorithm needs to read the original file, process it, and create a compressed version before upload

3. Backward Compatibility:
   - Our app supports Android 10 (API 29) and above, where some Storage Access Framework features have limitations
   - We need to maintain compatibility with older Android versions while gradually migrating to modern APIs

MIGRATION PLAN:

We are actively working on migrating to Storage Access Framework and Media Store API:
- Phase 1: Update file selection to use ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT consistently (in progress)
- Phase 2: Replace direct file access with ContentResolver-based file operations
- Phase 3: Remove deprecated MediaStore.DATA column usage
- Phase 4: Update Firebase Storage integration to work with content:// URIs directly
- Target completion: Next major release (within 3 months)

CURRENT PRIVACY MEASURES:
- We use FileProvider for secure file sharing between app components
- File selection uses ACTION_GET_CONTENT for user-controlled file access
- All file operations are scoped to app-specific directories where possible
- No unnecessary broad storage permissions are requested

We understand the importance of privacy-friendly practices and are committed to completing this migration as quickly as possible while ensuring app stability and functionality.
